## Simple Pagination
In this section, you will learn how to paginate a dataset using simple page and page_size parameters. By specifying the page number and the number of items per page, you can retrieve the desired subset of data. This method is commonly used in various applications and APIs.

## Hypermedia Metadata Pagination
Hypermedia Metadata Pagination is an advanced technique that provides additional information about the dataset, such as the total number of items, the number of pages, and links to navigate between pages. This approach enhances the user experience by offering more context and navigation options.

## Deletion-Resilient Pagination
Deletion-Resilient Pagination is a strategy to handle pagination when items are being deleted from the dataset. It ensures that the pagination remains consistent even if items are removed during the pagination process. This technique is useful in scenarios where the dataset is frequently updated or modified.

Feel free to explore the code examples and explanations provided in this repository to gain a better understanding of pagination techniques.
